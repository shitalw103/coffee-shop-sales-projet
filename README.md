**☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (Excel Project)**
**<br>📌 Project Overview**

The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data from a coffee shop to gain actionable insights that can enhance business performance.

Using Excel dashboards and analysis, I explored sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to help the coffee shop make data-driven decisions.

**🎯 Problem Statement**
